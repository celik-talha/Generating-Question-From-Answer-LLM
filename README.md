# Generating-Question-From-Answer-LLM
In this study, a natural language processing (NLP)
model was developed with the aim of generating a question
based on a given answer. Accordingly, the model was trained
using reversed token sequences as input. The primary purpose
of working with reversed token sequences is to adopt the
previous token prediction system used in the baseline GPT
model. Different models were trained using various learning
rates during the training process. Throughout the training, the
training and validation losses of both models were tracked, and
their performance was evaluated. Metrics were used to assess
model performance. Additionally, various parameter options
were provided for generating outputs from the model, allowing
for more creative responses. These models were made available
through a local interface for user interaction.
